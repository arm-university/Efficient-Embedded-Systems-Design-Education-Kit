Our flagship offering to universities worldwide is the Arm University Program Education Kit series.

These self-contained educational materials offered exclusively and at no cost to academics and teaching staff worldwide. They’re designed to support your day-to-day teaching on core electronic engineering and computer science subjects. You have the freedom to choose which modules to teach – you can use all the modules in the Education Kit or only those that are most appropriate to your teaching outcomes.

Our Efficient Embedded Systems Design Education Kit covers the fundamentals of Embedded Systems design, including how the theories and concepts can be applied in the design and efficient programming of embedded processor interfacing with both analog and digital input and output peripehrals. A full description of the education kit can be found [here](https://www.arm.com/resources/education/education-kits/efficient-embedded-systems).


 ## Kit specification:

* A full set of lecture slides, ready for use in a typical 10-12-week undergraduate course (full syllabus below).
* Recent updates to the EdKit include updated material on Armv8-M architecture and the Cortex-M33 processor, a dedicated module on Arm's system-wide Trustzone security technology and refreshed lab exercises on the ST Nucleo-L552ZE-Q board.
* Lab manual with solutions for faculty. Labs are based on low-cost yet powerful Arm-based hardware platforms donated by partners (subject to availability). 
* **Prerequisites:** Basics of C and assembly programming.

## Course Aim
To produce students who can design and efficiently program Arm-based embedded systems.

## Inclusive Language Commitment
Arm is committed to making the language we use inclusive, meaningful, and respectful. Our goal is to remove and replace non-inclusive language from our vocabulary to reflect our values and represent our global ecosystem.
 
Arm is working actively with our partners, standards bodies, and the wider ecosystem to adopt a consistent approach to the use of inclusive language and to eradicate and replace offensive terms. We recognise that this will take time. This course has been updated to replace references to non-inclusive language. We recognise that some of you will be accustomed to using the previous terms and may not immediately recognise their replacements. Please refer to the following example:

•	When introducing the AMBA 3 AHB-Lite Protocols, we will use the term ‘Manager’ instead of ‘Master’ and ‘Subordinate’ instead of ‘Slave’. 

This course may still contain other references to non-inclusive language; it will be updated with newer terms as those terms are agreed and ratified with the wider community.

Contact us at education@arm.com with questions or comments about this course. You can also report non-inclusive and offensive terminology usage in Arm content at terms@arm.com.
